			In the youtube video “Humans Need Not Apply” talks about rising issues that come with advancing of technology. With the advancement of all sorts of technology many jobs, including low paying, professional, and creative, could be replace by technology most likely robots. Due to robots being much more convenient, cheaper, reliable than people, human labor will be low in demand. For example robotic doctors will most likely replace humans due to the fact that robots will be exposed to a surplus of information that a human couldn’t never learn in their lifetime. Due to programers programing.

			Watching “Humans Need Not Apply” only confirmed my fears of the future and dangers that advance technology can cause in the near future. With tech becoming better and better every day and companies wanting to become much more efficient, soon hundreds of jobs can be placed in jeropary. Yet even though the field I want to work in is more on the creative side, how will it be until robots take over that as well. The ideas and concerns brought up in the video were also brought up in the 2018 game “Detroit Become Human”, that was the first time I was exposed to the dark side of advancement.Even though not the central theme of the story, the game subtle brings up the issue once human jobs being replaced by androids, with more advance androids being created to take on more complex jobs. Even though I don’t believe that “androids” will take on the majority of hard labor any time soon, I do believe that the human race in created the building blocks

				<h2>I relate to your title...</h2>

				<p>Even though I'm sure you didn't intend for your title to sound sarcastic, that's the way I read it. It's what I would say if a robot apocalypse ever happened since I would never take it seriously. I think fearing robots to most people is stupid, but it is a logical fear as there's a chance they can take over most our jobs one day, as you mentioned</p>

			In “Smile While We Snap” in the book, “Blown to Bits”, it talks about the pros and cons that come with having a camera in everyone’s pocket. With the advancement of phones and the ability for all of them to include a camera has helped many people while also hurting many others as well. For one a flasher can be stop once everyone in the city knows what he looks like but a woman can be public shamed for the actions of her animal. With the wider access to cameras, the world becomes even more interconnective. However with the world becoming more connected comes the downside of a lack of privacy and going against copyright. If someone uploads pictures from a unelsed book did that person commit copyright infringement? If cameras are everywhere are we ever really alone. Those are the questions we have to deal with, with the progression of human achievement.

			Radio Frequency Identifications also known as RFIDs, mention in “Knowing Even Where Your Shoes” are simply pieces of technology that can be used to identify all kinds of items from clothing to animals. RFIDs are useful since they don’t run on batteries and hence make it easier to use on multiple items. Companies use RFIDs to collect various different information from seeing what items are paired to other items and see which products get return the most as well. RFIDs help companies to improve their business practices subtle since a most RFID’s can hold up to dozens of information at once.

			In “Knowing Where You Are”, the section talks about the interesting uses of GPS. GPS stands for Global Positioning System and with its use of satellites can tell an accurate depiction of where you are. GPS are the most accurate way of telling where you are, even more than cell phones since it doesn't rely on cellular towers even, once helping to find a stranded woman on the mountains. Even though GPS can be used by an individual it also can be used by companies for a variety reasons. GPS is just one of many ways that companies and others are watching you.
